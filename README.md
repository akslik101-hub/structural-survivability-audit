# Structural Survivability Audit (SSA)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Author:** Bryan Paul  
**Status:** Stable Baseline  

## Overview

Structural Survivability Audit (SSA) is a constraint-first audit framework for evaluating the survivability of complex systems.

SSA synthesizes established resilience and failure-analysis approaches into a structured, boundary-driven checklist. It is not a replacement for FMEA, FTA, or resilience engineering methods, but a complementary audit lens focused on:

- Boundary definition  
- Dependency mapping  
- Redundancy classification  
- Slack analysis  
- Single-point failure exposure  

## Scope

SSA applies to engineered systems operating within defined constraints.

## Non-Scope

SSA does not address:
- Metaphysical claims  
- Ontology  
- Universal theory  
- General philosophy  

It is a practical audit tool.

## Use

SSA is intended for:
- Software systems  
- Digital infrastructure  
- Complex engineered environments  
- AI systems  
- Organizational structures (with caution)  

## Failure Clause

If SSA cannot expose structural weaknesses in a system that later fails under foreseeable stress, SSA should be revised or discarded.
